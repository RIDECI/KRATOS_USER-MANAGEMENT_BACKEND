## 🏛️ Project Architecture

The KRATOS - User Management have a unacoplated hexagonal - clean architecture where looks for isolate the business logic with the other part of the app dividing it in multiple components:

### 🧠 DOMAIN (Core)

**Purpose:** It represents the **core of the business** and contains the most important concepts of the application. It defines **WHAT** the system does, not **HOW** it does it.

**Contains:**

- **Entities:** User.
- **Enums:** Role (STUDENT, TEACHER, ADMINISTRATOR), AccountState (ACTIVE, INACTIVE, PENDING, SUSPENDED), IdentificationType (TI, CC, PP, CE).

**Key principle:** This layer should NOT depend on external frameworks, databases or technologies.

### 🎯 APPLICATION (Aplicación)

**Purpose:** Encapsulates the **application logic** and defines the **use cases** of the system. Orchestrate how the domain is used to solve specific problems.

**Contains:**

- **Use Cases:**
  - CreateUserUseCase: Create a new user
  - UpdateUserUseCase: Update personal information
  - DeleteUserUseCase: Delete User
  - GetUserUseCase: Get user by id
  - GetAllUsersUseCase: Get all users
- **OUTs:** EventPublisher, UserRepositoryOutPort
- **LISTENERs:** UserRegisteredListener
- **Mapper:** UserMapperApplication
- **Service:** UserService

### 🏛️ INFRASTRUCTURE (Infraestructura)

**Purpose:** Implements the **technical details** that allow the system to function. It handles persistence, file storage, external communication, and configuration.

**Contains:**
- **config:** RabbitConfig Configuration
- **API/Controllers:** REST endpoints for user management.
- **DTOs:** UserRequest, UserResponse
- **Repositories:** Implementations using Spring Data MongoDB (UserRepository)
- **External Services:** RabbitEventPublisher
**Feature:** This layer DOES depend on frameworks and technologies (Spring Boot, MongoDB, Railway, etc.).


The use of this architecture has the following benefits:

* ✅ **Separation of Concerns:** Distinct boundaries between logic and infrastructure.
* ✅ **Maintainability:** Easier to update or replace specific components.
* ✅ **Scalability:** Components can evolve independently.
* ✅ **Testability:** The domain can be tested in isolation without a database or server.

# 🔗 Connections with other Microservices

This module does not work alone. It interacts with the RideCi Ecosystem via REST APIs and Message Brokers (RabbitMQ):

1. Authentication Microservice: Responsible for receiving user data and constructing the UserDocument.
2. Profiles Microservice: The Profiles Microservice depends on user-related data provided by other services.
Specifically, it requires only the User ID and User Name in order to build and maintain user profile information.
It does not handle authentication data directly; instead, it focuses exclusively on profile attributes and associations.

# 📐 System Architecture & Design

This section provides a visual representation of the module's architecture ilustrating the base diagrams to show the application structure and components flow.

### 🧩 Context Diagram
---
Text

![Context Diagram](./docs/uml/diagrama_contexto.png)

### 🧩 Specific Components Diagram
---
This diagram illustrates the structure and dependencies between components in the User Management and Authentication microservices.
Both services apply Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters), ensuring separation of concerns, maintainability, and independent testability.

*Authentication*:

This module handles user authentication and token generation. It is organized into controllers, adapters, use cases, and outbound ports.

* Controllers:
    * Auth Controller
      Receives and processes all HTTP requests related to login and registration.
      It converts these inputs into internal DTOs and forwards them to the adapters.

When applying a hexagonal architecture, before developing the use cases, we need adapter components:

* Use Cases:

    * Login Use Case:
      Validates credentials and triggers token generation.

    * Register User Use Case:
      Registers a new user in the system through the outbound port.

    * Generate Token Use Case:
      Issues security tokens (e.g., JWT) after a successful authentication.

* Ports:

    * Database Port:
      Allows the use cases to persist or retrieve authentication-related data.

*User Management*:

This service handles user lifecycle (create, update, delete, retrieve) following strict hexagonal architecture separation.

* Controllers:

  * User Controller:
    Central entry point for all user-related API requests.
    It delegates the execution to the User Adapter and relies on DTOs for communication.

* Use Cases:

  These represent application-specific business rules:

   * Create User Use Case:
    Handles registration logic within the User Management context.

   * Update User Use Case:
    Manages modifications to user profiles.

   * Delete User Use Case:
    Performs logical deletion of a user.

   * Get User Use Case:
    Retrieves user information by ID.

   * Get Users Use Case:
    Provides user listing with optional filters.

* Ports

  Ports define what the application expects from its infrastructure:

  * User Repository Port:
    Interface that declares what operations the domain needs from the persistence layer.
